> *Frontend for [LLM-API](https://github.com/Coosanta17/LLM-API) using Svelte*

See it at https://chat.coosanta.net/ 

***

This is a frontend "example" of an API that I created from scratch in Java (see more [here (LLM API Backend)](https://github.com/Coosanta17/LLM-API)) to learn about reactive web-development and Svelte. 

Due to this being a learning journey the code is a complete and utter mess, and as programmers would call it - "Spaghetti Code". I plan on fixing this in the hopefully not too distant future.

Because I am hosting this on limited resources, the AI may (and probably will) take a long time to respond, please be patient!

If you find any errors anywhere please feel free to make an [issue](https://github.com/Coosanta17/LLM-Frontend/issues)
